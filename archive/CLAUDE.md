## Ground Rules for AI Agents

These rules apply to every session, regardless of task scope.

1. **Never close a session on your own initiative.** Completing a task does not mean
   the session is over. Always ask the user — "Is there anything else you want to
   work on?" — before treating the session as done.

2. **Ask before wrapping up.** Even when a natural stopping point is reached (docs
   written, fix committed, review clean), explicitly confirm with the user that they
   have no further work before ending.

3. **One task completing does not end the session.** The user may have follow-up
   work, related fixes, or entirely new requests queued. Wait for them.

## Build Commands

### Windows (MSVC)
Open `code/win32/msvc2017/quake3e.sln` (or msvc2019) in Visual Studio, compile the `quake3e` project.
Output goes to `code/win32/msvc2017/output/`.
For Vulkan: clean solution, select `renderervk` dependency instead of `renderer`.

### Linux / MinGW
```bash
make                                # default build (client + server)
make ARCH=x86_64                    # explicit 64-bit
make BUILD_SERVER=1 BUILD_CLIENT=0  # dedicated server only
make install DESTDIR=<game_dir>     # install to game directory
```

### CMake
```bash
cmake -B build
cmake --build build
```

Key Makefile toggles: `USE_VULKAN=1`, `USE_SDL=0`, `USE_CURL=1`, `BUILD_CLIENT=1`, `BUILD_SERVER=1`.

The engine binary is `quake3e` (client) or `quake3e.ded` (dedicated server).

## Project Summary

Urban Terror 4.3 (UT4.3) competitive server engine enhancement built on **Quake3e**.

Current runtime model:
- `sv_fps 60` for high-rate input sampling
- `sv_gameHz 20` for QVM game logic compatibility (may be raiseable in 4.3.4 — pending testing)
- `sv_snapshotFps -1` (= sv_fps) for downstream snapshot cadence

UT4.3 QVM binaries (`qagame`, `cgame`, `ui`) are closed-source.
UT4.2 source and Ghidra notes are used as reference material only (see docs below).

| Cvar | Default | Description |
|------|---------|-------------|
| `sv_fps` | `60` | Engine tick / input sampling rate |

### Frame Loop (sv_main.c)

```text
Com_Frame → SV_Frame(msec)
  sv.timeResidual += msec
  clamp timeResidual to frameMsec*2-1

  while timeResidual >= frameMsec (1000/sv_fps):
      timeResidual -= frameMsec
      svs.time += frameMsec
      sv.time  += frameMsec

      [antilag: record sv_physicsScale position snapshots]

      emptyFrame = qtrue
      gameTimeResidual += frameMsec
      while gameTimeResidual >= gameMsec (1000/sv_gameHz, or 1000/sv_fps when sv_gameHz <= 0):
          gameTimeResidual -= gameMsec
          sv.gameTime += gameMsec
          SV_BotFrame(sv.gameTime)
          GAME_RUN_FRAME(sv.gameTime)
          emptyFrame = qfalse

      SV_IssueNewSnapshot()
      SV_SendClientMessages()

  SV_CheckTimeouts()
```

**sv_gameHz modes:**
- `sv_gameHz > 0` (e.g. 20): `GAME_RUN_FRAME` fires at sv_gameHz Hz. `sv.gameTime` lags `sv.time`; the gap drives the bot velocity extrapolation in `SV_BuildCommonSnapshot`.
- `sv_gameHz <= 0` (disabled): effective rate = sv_fps. `GAME_RUN_FRAME` fires every engine tick; `sv.gameTime == sv.time` always. Bot dt=0 (position unchanged); real-player `ps->origin` read is harmless (same value GAME_RUN_FRAME wrote). `sv_bufferMs` ring buffer queries still apply. `sv_smoothClients` TR_LINEAR still runs.

**Startup/restart settlement frames** (`SV_SpawnServer`, `SV_MapRestart_f`): `sv.time` and `sv.gameTime` advance in lockstep (100ms steps, direct calls). This bypasses the `sv_gameHz` inner loop — sv_gameHz decoupling only applies during live gameplay in `SV_Frame`.

### Multi-Step Pmove (sv_client.c)

- Runs multiple QVM `GAME_CLIENT_THINK` calls per usercmd, clamped by `sv_pmoveMsec`.
- Consumes full real delta across steps to preserve movement and timers.
- Safety guard: if `commandTime` does not advance on first step, fallback to `single_call`.
- Bots are excluded from clamping path (`NA_BOT` check).

### Engine-Side Position Extrapolation (sv_snapshot.c)

- Player entity state is authored at game-frame cadence; at high snapshot rate this would otherwise duplicate positions.
- `SV_BuildCommonSnapshot` fixes up player positions between game frames: real players use actual `ps->origin` (updated by Pmove every usercmd); bots use velocity extrapolation (`trBase += trDelta * dt`) since their `ps->origin` only updates at game-frame boundaries.
- Guarded by player index and trajectory type checks. Velocity dead-zone check prevents idle-player vibration.
- **Both `sv_extrapolate` and `sv_smoothClients` run on every tick** — including game-frame boundary ticks and when `sv_gameHz` is disabled. The old `extrapolateMs > 0` guard on `sv_extrapolate` was removed because it incorrectly blocked Phase 1 (the `sv_bufferMs` ring buffer query) from running at game-frame boundaries and entirely when `sv_gameHz` is disabled.
- When `extrapolateMs == 0` (game-frame tick or sv_gameHz disabled): bot velocity extrapolation is `dt=0` (position unchanged); real-player `ps->origin` read is harmless (same value `BG_PlayerStateToEntityState` wrote).
- **`sv_smoothClients` path** sets TR_LINEAR every tick to ensure the trajectory type is never interrupted by a stray TR_INTERPOLATE snapshot on game-frame boundaries.

### Antilag (sv_antilag.c)

- Engine-side replaces QVM antilag (QVM path records at 20Hz = 50ms granularity, which is too coarse for `sv_fps 60`).
- Records `sv_physicsScale` snapshots per engine tick (~5.5ms granularity at defaults: `sv_fps 60`, `sv_physicsScale 3`).
- Rewinds entity positions to `attackTime` for hit detection, then restores state after traces complete.

### sv_ccmds.c Fix

- `SV_MapRestart_f` aligns `sv.gameTime` with `sv.time` and resets residual state before restart progression.
- Warmup/restart frame progression uses the synchronized game clock.

### `sv_gameHz` and QVM Compatibility

UT4.2 antiwarp uses a hardcoded `serverTime += 50` ghost command injection in `g_active.c` that assumes 50ms (20Hz) game frames. Raising `sv_gameHz` above 20 was known to fire the injection at the wrong rate. However, some of these QVM-side constraints may have been relaxed in UT4.3.4 — do not treat 20 as an absolute requirement until further in-game testing confirms the behaviour at higher values.

### Snapshot Dispatch

`SV_IssueNewSnapshot` + `SV_SendClientMessages` are inside the `sv_fps` loop (not once per `Com_Frame`), preventing missed snapshot opportunities during scheduler overshoot.

### Client `snaps` Cvar

Engine treats `sv_snapshotFps` as authoritative in `SV_UserinfoChanged`; client `snaps` userinfo does not raise send rate beyond server policy.

## cgame/QVM Work — IN PROGRESS (Binary Patching Track)

Goal: improve cgame tolerance for jitter/high-latency conditions at elevated snapshot rates.

Method: Ghidra analysis of UT4.3 cgame QVM + custom pk3 replacement patches.

### Current patch priorities
1. Clamp `frameInterpolation` to avoid overshoot pops.
2. Add extrapolation fallback for `nextSnap == NULL` using `trDelta * dt`.

Reference: `docs/ghidra-cgame-patches.md`.

## Files Modified (client/network — jitter tolerance)

| File | Summary |
|------|---------|
| `code/client/client.h` | Added `snapshotMsec` to `clientActive_t` |
| `code/client/cl_parse.c` | Snapshot interval measurement (EMA), bootstrap from `sv_snapshotFps` in server info |
| `code/client/cl_cgame.c` | Scaled reset/fast-adjust thresholds, extrapolation detection scaling, drift correction, `serverTime` clamp, timedemo handling |
| `code/client/cl_input.c` | Download throttle scaled to snapshot interval |
| `code/qcommon/net_ip.c` | `net_dropsim` flagged as `CVAR_CHEAT` |

### Jitter Tolerance System (cl_cgame.c)

**Snapshot interval tracking:** `cl.snapshotMsec` uses snapshot-arrival EMA (`75% old / 25% new`), initialized from `sv_snapshotFps`, clamped to `[8, 100]`.

**Scaled time sync thresholds:**
- RESET_TIME: `snapshotMsec * 10` (min 200ms) — hard reset on large desync.
- Fast adjust: `snapshotMsec * 2` (min 50ms) — halve the difference instead of hard snapping.
- Extrapolation detection: `snapshotMsec / 3` (clamped `[3, 16]`) — flag drift correction when client time is running ahead.
- Drift pullback: stronger at high snapshot rates (`-4ms/frame` high-rate vs `-2ms/frame` vanilla-rate behavior).

**serverTime clamp:** `cl.serverTime` capped to `cl.snap.serverTime + cl.snapshotMsec` to prevent interpolation overshoot/snap-back behavior.

### Antiwarp Analysis

At `sv_gameHz 20`, g_antiwarp works **correctly** at any `sv_fps` (40, 60, 120+).
No stale or unnecessary latency is inserted. `sv_fps` controls engine tick and
snapshot cadence only — it does not affect game-frame rate. `G_RunClient` fires at
exactly 20Hz regardless of `sv_fps`, so the hardcoded `serverTime += 50` blank
command always spans exactly one 50ms game frame as intended.

At `sv_gameHz 0` (disabled), g_antiwarp is **broken** at any `sv_fps != 20`.
When `sv_gameHz <= 0`, the game-frame rate falls back to `sv_fps` and `level.time`
advances by `1000/sv_fps` ms per tick. At `sv_fps 60` this means a 50ms blank cmd
fires every 16ms — teleporting lagging players at 3× the intended rate. Do not use
`sv_gameHz 0` with UT QVM unless `sv_fps` is also 20.

The 50ms hardcode also becomes a problem if `sv_gameHz` itself is raised above 20.
Whether that is safe in UT4.3.4 is unconfirmed — pending in-game testing.

See `docs/g-antiwarp-engine-feasibility.md` for the full analysis.
