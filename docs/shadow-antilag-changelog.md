## Architecture recap

```
GAME TICK  (sv_gameHz Hz)        → QVM sees this. level.time advances here.
SHADOW RECORDING  (sv_fps Hz)    → Engine only. Records entity positions
                                    into svShadowHistory[] ring buffer.
HIT REGISTRY  (on G_TRACE)      → Engine intercepts trap_Trace from QVM.
                                    Rewinds entities → runs trace → restores.
                                    QVM never sees rewound state.
```

Two independent clocks:
- **`sv.time`** — resets on map change; sent to clients in snapshots
- **`svs.time`** — persists across map changes; wall-clock server time

Clients calibrate their `serverTime` estimate from snapshots, so
`lastUsercmd.serverTime` is in the **`sv.time`** domain.

## PR #35 — Fire time & shadow history config fixes

**Merged:** 2026-03-03 · **Files:** `sv_antilag.c`, `sv_antilag.h`, `sv_main.c`

### Fix 1: Fire time over-rewind (primary)

**Bug:** `SV_Antilag_GetClientFireTime` used `svs.time - cl->ping` as the
rewind target. `cl->ping` is the full round-trip time, but the client's
perception of server time is approximately half RTT in the past. A 40 ms
ping player got a 40 ms rewind when the correct value is ~20 ms.

```c
// BEFORE (original)
fireTime = svs.time - cl->ping;

// AFTER (PR #35)
fireTime = cl->lastUsercmd.serverTime;
```

**Why `lastUsercmd.serverTime`:**
- Set from the usercmd *before* `GAME_CLIENT_THINK` fires
- Available during weapon traces (QVM sees it as `AttackTime`)
- Already incorporates `cl_timeNudge` / `cl_autoNudge` from the client
- Makes `ut_timenudge` correctly irrelevant (shadow rewind overrides FIFO)

### ~~Fix 2: Bots excluded from shadow history recording~~ (REVERTED)

**Original change:** Removed the `NA_BOT` filter so bots were recorded
into shadow history, reasoning that humans shooting at bots needed lag
compensation.

**Reverted:** Bots are correctly excluded from shadow recording. The
QVM's FIFO antilag already handles bot targets (FIFO skips bots — they
have zero lag — so their position is already correct at trace time).
Recording bots into shadow history causes a double-rewind conflict:
FIFO shifts the bot to position A, then shadow overwrites with position B
computed from a different time formula (`sv.time - ping/2` vs FIFO's
`level.time` domain). The trace runs against a position neither system
intended.

Bots are still **skipped as shooters** in `InterceptTrace` (zero lag).

### Fix 3: sv_fps change detection race

**Bug:** `sv_fps->modified` is cleared by `SV_TrackCvarChanges` before
`SV_Antilag_RecordPositions` runs, so `sv_fps` changes were never detected.

```c
// BEFORE
if ( sv_physicsScale->modified || sv_antilagMaxMs->modified || sv_fps->modified )

// AFTER — track integer value directly
static int sv_antilag_lastFpsValue = 0;
int currentFps = sv_fps ? sv_fps->integer : 40;
qboolean fpsChanged = ( currentFps != sv_antilag_lastFpsValue );
if ( sv_physicsScale->modified || sv_antilagMaxMs->modified || fpsChanged )
```

### Fix 4: Stale history on cvar round-trip

**Bug:** Ring buffer flush was conditional on slot count changing. A
round-trip like `sv_fps 60→40→60` keeps the same slot count but leaves
entries with wrong timestamp spacing, producing incorrect interpolation.

```c
// BEFORE — only flush if slot count changed
if ( sv_shadowHistorySlots != oldSlots ) {
    Com_Memset( sv_shadowHistory, 0, sizeof( sv_shadowHistory ) );
}

// AFTER — always flush on any timing change
Com_Memset( sv_shadowHistory, 0, sizeof( sv_shadowHistory ) );
```

### Fix 5: Duplicate-timestamp entries from physicsScale loop

**Bug:** `SV_Frame` called `RecordPositions` in a `physicsScale` loop
(e.g. 3×), but all calls used the same `svs.time`, filling 2/3 of the
ring buffer with duplicate timestamps and reducing effective history
coverage to ~175 ms instead of 200 ms (24 slots / 3 per tick = 8 unique
timestamps spanning 7 × 25 ms).

```c
// BEFORE (sv_main.c) — recorded 3× per tick with same timestamp
for ( _s = 0; _s < _scale; _s++ ) {
    SV_Antilag_RecordPositions();
}

// AFTER (sv_main.c) — record once per engine tick
SV_Antilag_RecordPositions();
```

### Fix 6: Config/recording rate mismatch

**Bug:** After removing the physicsScale loop, `ComputeConfig` still
calculated slots for `fps × scale` Hz instead of the actual `fps` Hz
recording rate.

```c
// BEFORE
int shadowHz = fps * scale;
sv_shadowTickMs = 1000 / shadowHz;
sv_shadowHistorySlots = ( shadowHz * winMs ) / 1000;

// AFTER — based on fps alone
sv_shadowTickMs = 1000 / fps;
sv_shadowHistorySlots = ( fps * winMs ) / 1000 + 1;
```

### Fix 7: Off-by-one in slot count

**Bug:** `(Hz * windowMs) / 1000` under-counts by 1 because N slots span
N−1 intervals. At defaults (40 Hz, 200 ms) this gave 8 slots = 175 ms
instead of 9 slots = 200 ms.

```c
// BEFORE
sv_shadowHistorySlots = ( shadowHz * winMs ) / 1000;

// AFTER — +1 to cover full window
sv_shadowHistorySlots = ( fps * winMs ) / 1000 + 1;
```

## PR #36 — sv.time / svs.time domain fix

**Status:** Merged · **Files:** `sv_antilag.c`

### The core problem

PR #35 correctly changed the fire time formula to
`cl->lastUsercmd.serverTime`, but all the **surrounding comparisons**
(clamps, fallback, recording timestamps) still used `svs.time`.

Since `lastUsercmd.serverTime` is calibrated from snapshots (which send
`sv.time`), the value is in the `sv.time` domain. After a map change the
two clocks diverge:

```
svs.time = 500100      // persisted from previous map
sv.time  = 408         // reset on map load
fireTime = ~400        // from lastUsercmd.serverTime, calibrated via sv.time

svs.time - fireTime = 499700  >>  maxRewind (200)
→ every shot clamped to 200 ms rewind regardless of actual ping
```

### Fix 1: Recording timestamps — `svs.time` → `sv.time`

Shadow history must be in the same time domain as `fireTime` so the
interpolation lookup finds correct entries.

```c
// BEFORE (after PR #35)
SV_Antilag_RecordClient( i, svs.time );

// AFTER (PR #36)
SV_Antilag_RecordClient( i, sv.time );
```

### Fix 2: Fire time clamps — `svs.time` → `sv.time`

```c
// BEFORE — fallback and clamps used svs.time
if ( shooterNum < 0 || shooterNum >= sv_maxclients->integer )
    return svs.time;
...
if ( svs.time - fireTime > maxRewind )
    fireTime = svs.time - maxRewind;
if ( fireTime > svs.time )
    fireTime = svs.time;

// AFTER — all in sv.time domain
if ( shooterNum < 0 || shooterNum >= sv_maxclients->integer )
    return sv.time;
...
if ( sv.time - fireTime > maxRewind )
    fireTime = sv.time - maxRewind;
if ( fireTime > sv.time )
    fireTime = sv.time;
```

### Fix 3: Save/restore simplification

**Before:** `RewindAll` called `SV_Antilag_GetMostRecentPosition` to
get the "true" position from shadow history, saving that instead of the
entity's actual current position. This was originally to override FIFO
state, but:
- For bots (no FIFO shift), shadow-history "true pos" == current pos
- For humans, the FIFO has already shifted them; saving FIFO state is
  correct because `G_UnTimeShiftAllClients` expects to undo exactly that

**After:** Save `gent->r.currentOrigin` directly. Removed
`SV_Antilag_GetMostRecentPosition()` entirely.

```c
// BEFORE — two-path save via shadow history lookup
if ( SV_Antilag_GetMostRecentPosition( i, trueOrigin, trueAbsmin, trueAbsmax ) ) {
    sv_shadowSaved[i].saved = qtrue;
    VectorCopy( trueOrigin, sv_shadowSaved[i].origin );
    ...
} else {
    sv_shadowSaved[i].saved = qtrue;
    VectorCopy( gent->r.currentOrigin, sv_shadowSaved[i].origin );
    ...
}

// AFTER — always save current entity position
sv_shadowSaved[i].saved = qtrue;
VectorCopy( gent->r.currentOrigin, sv_shadowSaved[i].origin );
VectorCopy( gent->r.absmin,        sv_shadowSaved[i].absmin );
VectorCopy( gent->r.absmax,        sv_shadowSaved[i].absmax );
```

### Fix 4: No-history fallback simplification

**Before:** When no shadow history existed for `targetTime`, the code
force-wrote the saved position back into the entity and re-linked it
(a no-op write that still cost a `SV_LinkEntity` call).

**After:** Just leave the entity at its current position. The trace runs
against whatever position the QVM has set.

### Fix 5: Debug output — `svs.time` → `sv.time`

```c
// BEFORE
int rewindMs = svs.time - fireTime;
Com_Printf( "... (svs.time=%d fireTime=%d)\n", ..., svs.time, fireTime );

// AFTER
int rewindMs = sv.time - fireTime;
Com_Printf( "... (sv.time=%d fireTime=%d)\n", ..., sv.time, fireTime );
```

### Intentionally NOT changed: Rate tracking

`SV_Antilag_NoteSnapshot` uses `svs.time` to measure snapshot send rate.
This is correct — it measures wall-clock intervals, not game time. The
rate tracking system is unrelated to the rewind calculations.

---

## PR #37 — Fire time formula revision (ping/2)

**Status:** Merged · **Files:** `sv_antilag.c`, `sv_antilag.h`, `docs/Example_server.cfg`

### The core problem

PR #35 changed the fire time from `svs.time - cl->ping` to
`cl->lastUsercmd.serverTime`. While `lastUsercmd.serverTime` is in the
correct `sv.time` domain, it includes the client's **local interpolation
delay** (cl_timeNudge, cl_autoNudge, snapshot buffering) on top of the
network latency. This produces excessive rewind:

```
ping = 45 ms        → expected half-RTT rewind ≈ 22 ms
lastUsercmd rewind  → actual rewind = 69–77 ms  (1.5× full RTT)
```

The extra ~47 ms comes from the client's interpolation pipeline:
- `cl_autoNudge` adds approximately `snapInterval / 2` (~16 ms)
- Snapshot smoothing / `CL_AdjustTimeDelta` adds another ~16–25 ms
- These offsets are correct for the QVM's FIFO antilag (which operates in
  the `level.time` domain where they cancel out), but in the shadow system
  they double-up because shadow history already records at `sv.time`

The result: hits feel delayed and spongy compared to the QVM's own FIFO
antilag. Reverting to `sv_antilagEnable 0` restores responsiveness because
the FIFO system's `level.time` domain absorbs the interpolation delay
naturally.

### Fix 1: Fire time — `lastUsercmd.serverTime` → `sv.time - ping/2`

```c
// BEFORE (after PR #35 + PR #36)
fireTime = cl->lastUsercmd.serverTime;

// AFTER (PR #37)
fireTime = sv.time - cl->ping / 2;
```

**Why `sv.time - cl->ping / 2`:**
- `cl->ping` is the full round-trip time, measured by the engine
- `ping / 2` approximates one-way latency (server → client)
- Shadow history records at `sv.time`, so rewinding by one-way latency
  gives the position the client was seeing when they fired
- Does not include client interpolation delay → rewind is tight and
  responsive
- For bots (ping = 0): `sv.time - 0 = sv.time` → no rewind (correct,
  bots are already skipped as shooters in `InterceptTrace`)

**Example improvement (45 ms ping player):**

| Formula | Rewind | Feel |
|---------|--------|------|
| `svs.time - cl->ping` (original) | 45 ms, wrong domain | broken after map change |
| `cl->lastUsercmd.serverTime` (PR #35) | 69–77 ms | spongy, delayed |
| `sv.time - cl->ping / 2` (PR #37) | 22 ms | responsive, accurate |

### Fix 2: Header cvar name mismatch

`sv_antilag.h` declared `sv_antilagTraceLog` and `sv_snapRateLog`, but
`sv_antilag.c` defines `sv_antilagDebug` and `sv_antilagRateDebug`.
Fixed the header externs to match the implementation.

```c
// BEFORE (sv_antilag.h)
extern cvar_t *sv_antilagTraceLog;
extern cvar_t *sv_snapRateLog;

// AFTER
extern cvar_t *sv_antilagDebug;
extern cvar_t *sv_antilagRateDebug;
```

### Fix 3: Example config cvar names

`docs/Example_server.cfg` referenced stale names (`sv_antilagEnable`)
and wrong header names. Updated:
- `sv_antilagEnable` → `sv_antilag` (matches the registered cvar name)
- `sv_antilagRateDebug` was already correct

## PR #38 — Fire time corrected to full RTT; sv_physicsScale removed

**Files:** `sv_antilag.c`, `sv_antilag.h`, `docs/Example_server.cfg`, `docs/project/SERVER.md`, `docs/project/FLOWCHART.md`

### Fix 7: Fire time under-compensation (ping/2 → ping)

**Bug:** PR #37's formula `sv.time - cl->ping / 2` only compensated for
one network hop (server→client), ignoring the return hop (client→server).

**Timing proof:**

```
T0         position recorded in shadow history; snapshot built; sent
           messageSent = Sys_Milliseconds() = T0_wall
T0+RTT/2   client receives snapshot; sees target at sv.time = T0
T0+RTT/2   client fires; sends usercmd
T0+RTT     server receives usercmd
           messageAcked = Sys_Milliseconds() = T0_wall + RTT
           cl->ping = messageAcked - messageSent = RTT  (server-measured)
           sv.time ≈ T0 + RTT  (advances at 1 ms per real-ms)
```

The target was at position `T0` when the client aimed. `sv.time` when the
trace runs is `T0 + RTT`. Correct rewind = **full RTT = `cl->ping`**.

`ping/2` only subtracts one hop, leaving the target `RTT/2 ≈ ping/2` ms
too far forward — the shooter must visually lead the target by half their
own ping. At 40 ms ping this is a 20 ms positional error (~128 units at
320 ups), noticeable and physically wrong.

```c
// BEFORE (PR #37)
fireTime = sv.time - cl->ping / 2;

// AFTER (PR #38)
fireTime = sv.time - cl->ping;
```

**Why not `lastUsercmd.serverTime`:**
`cl->lastUsercmd.serverTime` is the client's reported render time. It
already contains the RTT *plus* the client's interpolation buffer
(`cl_autoNudge`, `CL_AdjustTimeDelta` — typically +30–50 ms), so it
over-compensates to ~69–77 ms for a 45 ms ping player (confirmed by PR
#37 measurement). The full-RTT formula `sv.time - ping` gives the exact
snapshot time (45 ms for 45 ms ping) without including the client-side
interpolation lag — which the shadow system already handles through linear
interpolation between recorded entries.

**Example (45 ms ping):**

| Formula | Rewind | Assessment |
|---------|--------|------------|
| `svs.time - cl->ping` (original) | 45 ms — wrong domain | domain bug |
| `cl->lastUsercmd.serverTime` (PR #35) | 69–77 ms | over-compensates (interp buffer) |
| `sv.time - cl->ping / 2` (PR #37) | 22 ms | under-compensates (half RTT) |
| `sv.time - cl->ping` (PR #38) | **45 ms** | **exact** |

### Fix 8: sv_physicsScale cvar removed

The `sv_physicsScale` cvar was registered and watched for `->modified`
but its value was never read. The physicsScale loop in `SV_Frame` was
removed in Fix 5 (PR #35), and `ComputeConfig` uses `sv_fps` Hz only.

- Removed from `sv_antilag.c` (declaration, `Cvar_Get`, `->modified` watch)
- Removed from `sv_antilag.h` (extern)
- Removed from `docs/Example_server.cfg`, `docs/project/SERVER.md`,
  `docs/project/FLOWCHART.md`

## PR #39 — Recording order fix; snapshot-interval compensation

**Files:** `sv_main.c`, `sv_antilag.c`

### Fix 9: Shadow recording order (before-game-frame → after-game-frame)

**Bug:** `SV_Antilag_RecordPositions()` ran **before** `GAME_RUN_FRAME` in
each engine tick. This meant `shadow[T]` held entity positions from the
end of the *previous* tick (pre-game-frame state), while the snapshot
sent at tick T carried post-game-frame positions. Every fire-time lookup
was pointing at positions one tick stale relative to what the snapshot
showed.

```
BEFORE (sv_main.c per-tick order):
  sv.time += frameMsec
  SV_Antilag_RecordPositions()   ← records pre-game positions at sv.time = T
  GAME_RUN_FRAME                 ← entities move; weapon traces fire here
  SV_SendClientMessages()        ← snapshot carries post-game positions at T

  Result: shadow[T] = P_{N-1}  but  snapshot[T] = P_N  (mismatch)

AFTER:
  sv.time += frameMsec
  GAME_RUN_FRAME                 ← entities move; weapon traces fire here
  SV_Antilag_RecordPositions()   ← records post-game positions at sv.time = T
  SV_SendClientMessages()        ← snapshot carries same post-game positions

  Result: shadow[T] = P_N  ==  snapshot[T] = P_N  ✓
```

With this fix, `shadow[T]` and `snapshot[T]` always hold the same entity
state, so fire-time lookups are consistent at all `sv_fps` rates.

### Fix 10: Snapshot-interval compensation in fire time

**Bug:** `fireTime = sv.time - cl->ping` rewound to the exact snapshot
time `T0`. But the Q3/URT client interpolates targets **one snapshot
interval behind** its latest received snapshot (`cl_interp ≈ snapshotMsec`
by default). The visual position of a target was therefore at
`T0 − snapshotMsec`, not `T0`.

**Full timing path (after Fix 9):**

```
T0          shadow records positions (after game frame, post-Fix 9)
T0          snapshot sent;  messageSent = Sys_Milliseconds()
            shadow[T0] == snapshot[T0]  ← guaranteed by Fix 9
T0+RTT/2    client receives snapshot; latest server time = T0
T0+RTT/2    client RENDERS target at T0 − snapshotMsec (cl_interp)
T0+RTT/2    client fires; sends usercmd
T0+RTT      server receives usercmd;  messageAcked = Sys_Milliseconds()
            cl->ping        = RTT       (server-measured)
            cl->snapshotMsec = 1000/snapHz  (per-client, from sv_fps / sv_snapshotFps)
            sv.time ≈ T0 + RTT
```

Target position the client aimed at: `shadow[T0 − snapshotMsec]`

```c
// BEFORE (PR #38)
fireTime = sv.time - cl->ping;
// → rewound to T0  (client was seeing T0 − snapshotMsec)

// AFTER (PR #39)
fireTime = sv.time - cl->ping - cl->snapshotMsec;
// = (T0 + RTT) − RTT − snapshotMsec = T0 − snapshotMsec  ✓
```

`cl->snapshotMsec` is **per-client** (`1000 / snapHz`, set from
`sv_fps` or `sv_snapshotFps` at connect/reconfigure). The formula is
therefore correct at any `sv_fps` rate — 20 Hz, 60 Hz, 125 Hz, etc.

**Limitation — dropped / late snapshots:**
If a snapshot is dropped in transit the client interpolates across a
two-snapshot gap. Its effective `cl_interp` increases by `snapshotMsec`
for that shot. The server has no visibility into which snapshot the client
used for aiming, so the rewind will be `snapshotMsec` too shallow and the
shot may miss the shadow interpolation window. This is unavoidable without
a client-side interp report.

**Example (40 ms ping, 60 Hz snaps → snapshotMsec = 16 ms):**

| Formula | Rewind | Assessment |
|---------|--------|------------|
| `sv.time - cl->ping / 2` (PR #37) | 20 ms | under-compensates |
| `sv.time - cl->ping` (PR #38) | 40 ms | misses interp offset |
| `sv.time - cl->ping - cl->snapshotMsec` (PR #39) | **56 ms** | **exact** |

## Review checklist

All items verified in the current codebase:

- [x] Fire time uses `sv.time - cl->ping - cl->snapshotMsec`.
      `cl->ping` = full RTT (server-measured); `cl->snapshotMsec` = per-client
      snapshot interval (`1000/snapHz`, from `sv_fps`/`sv_snapshotFps`) which
      represents the Q3/URT client's default `cl_interp` delay. Together they
      match the exact position the shooter was rendering when they fired.
      Works at any `sv_fps` rate because `snapshotMsec` is per-client.
      Known limitation: a dropped snapshot increases the client's effective
      `cl_interp` by one `snapshotMsec`; the server cannot detect this.
- [x] Shadow recording runs **after** the game frame in `SV_Frame`, ensuring
      `shadow[T]` holds post-game-frame entity positions == what the snapshot
      at time T delivers to clients. Previously recording ran before the game
      frame, so `shadow[T]` was one tick behind the snapshot.
- [x] `sv.time` is used consistently in all shadow antilag paths that
      compare against fire time or shadow history timestamps
- [x] `svs.time` is **only** used in `NoteSnapshot` rate tracking (wall-clock)
- [x] Bots are **excluded** from shadow history recording and rewind
      (`NA_BOT` filter in both `RecordPositions` and `RewindAll`). The
      QVM's own FIFO antilag handles bot targets correctly (bots have zero
      network lag — their current position is the correct trace target).
      Including bots in the shadow rewind would create a double-rewind
      conflict: FIFO moves the bot to position A, shadow overwrites with
      position B from a different time formula; the trace runs against a
      position neither system intended. Bots are also excluded as shooters
      in `InterceptTrace` (they have zero latency and need no rewind).
- [x] `ComputeConfig` slot count uses `sv_fps` Hz (not `fps × scale`)
      with `+1` to avoid off-by-one
- [x] History is always flushed on any timing config change (not just
      when slot count differs)
- [x] Recording happens once per engine tick (no `physicsScale` loop in
      `SV_Frame`)
- [x] `RewindAll` saves `gent->r.currentOrigin` directly — no
      `GetMostRecentPosition` lookup
- [x] `RestoreAll` restores saved position unconditionally after trace
- [x] The QVM contract is never violated: `level.time` is never touched,
      entities are restored before control returns to the VM
- [x] Header `sv_antilag.h` externs match `sv_antilag.c` definitions
      (`sv_antilag`, `sv_antilagMaxMs`, `sv_antilagDebug`,
      `sv_antilagRateDebug`). `sv_physicsScale` removed — cvar was dead
      (registered but never read; physicsScale loop removed in Fix 5).
- [x] Enable cvar is `sv_antilag` (not `sv_antilagEnable`); default is `0`
      (disabled — set `sv_antilag 1` in server config to enable)
